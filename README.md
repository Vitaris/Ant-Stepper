Ant-Stepper is a C library for the Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040) that leverages the chip’s unique Programmable IO (PIO) cores to generate hardware-accurate step and direction (step/dir) signals for stepper motors. The aim is to provide a fast, precise, and cost-effective solution for stepper motor control, closely emulating the performance of dedicated hardware step/dir generators.

## Features

- **Hardware-like Step/Dir Generation:** Utilizes the RP2040’s PIO subsystem to offload pulse generation from the main CPU, ensuring precise timing and minimal jitter.
- **High Performance:** Capable of generating high-frequency step pulses suitable for demanding motion control applications.
- **Flexible Configuration:** Easily configurable for different stepper drivers, step rates, and microstepping settings.
- **Low CPU Overhead:** The main application logic remains responsive, as the PIO handles the real-time pulse generation.
- **Open Source:** Freely available and modifiable for personal or commercial projects.

## Why Ant-Stepper?

Stepper motors require accurate and consistent step/dir signals for smooth and reliable operation. Traditional software-based pulse generation can suffer from timing issues, especially under heavy CPU load or when multitasking. By using the RP2040’s PIO cores, Ant-Stepper delivers hardware-level precision without the need for expensive external step generators.

## Target Platform

- **Microcontroller:** Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040)
- **Language:** C
- **PIO Utilization:** Takes full advantage of the RP2040’s PIO blocks for real-time signal generation

## Typical Applications

- 3D printers
